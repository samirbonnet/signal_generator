# C++23 Makefile Project Template

This is a fully featured Makefile project template for C++23 development.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source files
- `include/`: Header files
- `obj/`: Object files (created during build)
- `bin/`: Binary output
- `lib/`: Library files (if any)

## Building the Project

To build the project, use the following commands:

- For release build: `make release`
- For debug build: `make debug`
- To clean the project: `make clean`
- To run the program: `make run`

## Customizing the Project

1. Add your source files to the `src/` directory.
2. Add your header files to the `include/` directory.
3. Modify the Makefile if you need to add additional libraries or change compiler flags.
